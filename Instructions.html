                Catch The Fish is a game of speed where you see how many fish you can collect 
                within a 30 second time limit. When the game starts, you will see fish appear 
                on the screen, and you must click on them as quickly as possible to earn points.
                Each fish you catch will add 1 to your score. Try to catch as many fish as you can before
                the time runs out! Good luck and have fun!
