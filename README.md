# Catch the Fish

[My Notes](notes.md)

Catch the Fish will be a simple game where a user will see fish in the ocean, and atempt to catch as many as they can over a 30 second interval. Each time the player clicks on a fish it will dissapear and add to their total score displayed at the top of the screen. Users will be able to view their scores compared to others on the leaderboard from the menu or upon completion of the game.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

The ocean is full of incredible creatures, but the one we humans love the most is fish. We eat them, we admire them, but most of all, we love hunting for them. Catch the Fish draws you into a fast-paced competition where you race to collect as many fish as possible in the given time period. See if you have what it takes to become the fish-catching champion.

- **CSS** - Ocean/water color scheme, fish will highlight for a moment when clicked on.
- **React** - Single page application, reactive user controls, switching between views based on user interaction, storing and updating game information.
- **Service** -  Storing/retrieving scores, creating/pulling user login information for authentication and access control, third party call to get random fish facts or pictures of the ocean.
- **DB/Login** - Stores login information and game scores.
